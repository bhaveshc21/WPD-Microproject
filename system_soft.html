        <P>System software is software that directly operates the computer hardware and provides the basic functionality to the users as well as to the other software to operate smoothly. Or in other words, system software basically controls a computer’s internal functioning and also controls hardware devices such as monitors, printers, and storage devices, etc. </P>
        <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is like an interface between hardware and user applications, it helps them to communicate with each other because hardware understands machine language(i.e. 1 or 0) whereas user applications are work in human-readable languages like English, Hindi, German, etc. so system software converts the human-readable language into machine language and vice versa.</P><HR>

      <div class="container"><CENTER><H2>TYPES OF SYSTEM SOFTWARE</H2></CENTER>
  
        <P>It has 2 sub-types:</P>
        <ol><li><b>Operating System:</b> It is the main program of a computer system. When the computer system ON it is the first software that loads into the computer’s memory. Basically, it manages all the resources such as computer memory, CPU, printer, hard disk, etc., and provides an interface to the user, which helps the user to interact with the computer system. It also provides various services to other computer software. Examples of operating systems are Linux, Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, etc.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Language Processor:</b> As we know that system software converts the human-readable language into a machine language and vice versa. So, the conversion is done by the language processor. It converts programs written in high-level programming languages like Java, C, C++, Python, etc(known as source code), into sets of instructions that are easily readable by machines(known as object code or machine code).</li><br><br>
    
    
        <li><b>Device Driver:</b> A device driver is a program or software that controls a device and helps that device to perform its functions. Every device like a printer, mouse, modem, etc. needs a driver to connect with the computer system eternally. So, when you connect a new device with your computer system, first you need to install the driver of that device so that your operating system knows how to control or manage that device.</li><br><br>

      <P><B>Let us discuss some of the features of System Software:</B></P>
  
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        
       <LI>System Software is closer to the computer system.</LI><BR>
      <LI>System Software is written in a low-level language in general.</LI><BR>
      <LI>System software is difficult to design and understand.</LI><BR>
      <LI>System software is fast in speed(working speed).</LI><BR>
      <LI>System software is less interactive for the users in comparison to application software.</LI><BR>
