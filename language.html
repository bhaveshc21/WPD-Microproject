    <h2>What are Language processors? </h2>
    <p> &rarr; Language processors are software tools that translate high-level programming languages into machine-readable code or intermediate formats. They help convert human-readable code written in programming languages (such as C, Java, or Python) into a form that a computer can understand and execute.</p><hr>
    <h2><center>Why are Language Processors Important? </center></h2>

    <ol>
        <li> <b>Execution of Code:</b> Without language processors, computers wouldn't be able to understand high-level programming languages, which are much easier for humans to read and write.</li><br>
        <li> <b>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</b> Compilers and interpreters can allow a program written in a high-level language to be run on different platforms. For example, Java is compiled into bytecode by the javac compiler, which can then be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on various platforms.</li><br>
        <li><b>Optimization: </b> Compilers and other processors often include optimization steps that improve the performance of the code before execution.</li><br>
