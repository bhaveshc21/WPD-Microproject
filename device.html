    <h2>What are Device Drivers? </h2>
    <p> &rarr; A device driver is a specialized software component that allows an operating system (OS) to communicate with and control hardware devices.</p><hr>
    <h2><center>Key Functions of Device Drivers: </center></h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Communication:</b> Device drivers enable communication between the operating system and hardware peripherals like printers, monitors, keyboards, network adapters, and more.</li><br>
        <li> <b>Hardware Control:</b> Drivers translate high-level OS instructions into low-level instructions that the hardware device understands.</li><br>
        <li><b>Device Initialization:</b> When a hardware device is connected or turned on, the device driver helps initialize the device and set it up for use with the system.</li><br>
        <li><b>Error Handling:</b> Drivers manage error reporting and handling by informing the OS of hardware issues, such as device malfunctions or resource conflicts.</li><br>
        <li><b>Resource Management:</b> Device drivers help allocate and manage hardware resources like memory, input/output ports, and interrupt requests (IRQs) so that the device operates smoothly.</li><br>
